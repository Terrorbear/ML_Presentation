# ML_Presentation
Introductory presentation on using scikit learn in Jupyter

## Prep

All you need to do is install the scipy stack!

Follow the pip installation instructions [here](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
If you don't like reading, run the `pip install --user ...` command found halfway down the page.
If that doesn't work, go back and find the command to update pip.

## How to open the files.

* Open a terminal and navigate to the git repository.
* Run the command `jupyter notebook`.
* It'll open a tab in your favorite browser, and from there you'll see a list of directories.
* Navigate to the file you want to open.
* Voila! Play around to your heart's content.
